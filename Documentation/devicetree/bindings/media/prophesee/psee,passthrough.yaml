title: Prophesee Passthrough-capable streaming blocks

maintainers:
  - Christian Dreher <cdreher@prophesee.ai>

description: |
  Many blocks have the same overall interface, with an input AXI Stream, an
  output AXI Stream, and a AXI Lite to setup the block with register accesses.
  Such a block, with a compliant register map, may be set in bypass mode,
  outputing the input data with no alteration, making it useless, but at least
  allowing the pipeline to stream.

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - psee,passthrough

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  ports:
    $ref: /schemas/graph.yaml#/properties/ports

    properties:
      port@0:
        $ref: /schemas/graph.yaml#/$defs/port-base
        description: |
          Input/sink port node, describing the connection to the
          output of the uphill block in the hardware pipeline.

      port@1:
        $ref: /schemas/graph.yaml#/$defs/port-base
        description: |
          Output/source port node, describing the connection to the
          input of the downhill block in the hardware pipeline.
