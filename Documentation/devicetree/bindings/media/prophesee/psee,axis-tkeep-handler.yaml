title: Prophesee AXI4-Stream transfer merger

maintainers:
  - Christian Dreher <cdreher@prophesee.ai>

description: |
  The input of Prophesee FPGA Video pipeline is the Xilinx MIPI CSI-2 Rx IP.
  This IP output data on the full bus width (Prophesee does not use the Xilinx
  Video Format Bridge part of the IP), except on MIPI CSI-2 end of line, if the
  line length is not a multiple of the bus length, which happens for instance
  when the event size is smaller than the AXI4S bus width, and line transfer is
  triggered by timeout (to bound the latency of the system).
  This IP reaggregates AXI4S transfers (A single transfer is defined by a single
  TVALID, TREADY handshake; see ARM specification) based on the TKEEP signal to
  output only transfers using the full bus width, avoiding to the downstream IPs
  the burden of transfer merging.
  The IP also has the ability to switch the upper and the lower part of the data
  to convert the middle-endian Prophesee Evt2.1 format output by an IMX636
  sensor into little-endian Evt2.1 (allowing to plug an IMX636 on a pipeline
  working on Evt2.1 data.
